This course acts like a continuation to the previous basics of python course. Being the longest among the four it covers alot of topics including the ones which were discussed before. Talking about the concepts which were not covered in the previous course we see nested lists, 2d lists, list methods, dictionaries for data stuctures and their manipulation.
New important concepts include the concept of function and reusablity of code. Related topics are discussed along with it like arguments, parametres, excepctions and return statements. Comments are also discussed briefly in this section.
The other important concept that we move onto is that of a classes and constructors. Related topics of inheritance follow. These concepts are the soul of object oriented programming.
Lastly we are introduced to packages and package managers. Some important packages are discussed which help us to work with directories and generate random values. The package manager which is introduced is pip. At this point we are done with 2/3rds of the course and projects follow for the rest.
Three projects are taken up which go over automation, machine learning and web dev with django. These help us to learn the application of the concepts learned before and reinforces them because of their active use.
The course thereby concludes, providing us with extra resources to continue learning python in the description.
