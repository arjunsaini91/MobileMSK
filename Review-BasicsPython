The given one hour course starts off with installation of python. We are later introduced to print command and our taught to write a basic hello world program.
The course continues with variable declaration, type conversion, strings, operators, logical operators and operator precedence.
All the above concepts are discussed in the first half of the course and lays the ground work for the upcoming complex part of writing actual programs.
If statements are introduced which are important for any programming language and when the if-else is dicussed at length, we are introduced to an exercise.
The exercise involves a basic weight conversion program which uses all the above concepts which were discussed before. The program takes user input in kilos and converts into pounds.
Later on loops are discussed starting with while loop and their utility is demonstrated with pattern creation using ascii symbols.
Data strcutures are discussed next starting with lists and operation over lists, how to add and delete elements is gone over in brief
We revert back to loops leading us to for loops which are similar to while but serve in different use cases.
Data structures are continued with tuples after discussing range function in brief for the for loop. 
With this the course in concluded.
