Purpose of Medical Data in Delivering Personalised Medicine using AI

ï»¿The electronic medical record (EMR), which records all medical procedures such patient intake, examination, blood test, medication, operation, and medical expenses, is considered the most trustworthy medical data in the healthcare system with the advent of the big data era.With the aid of specially trained models, individualised medical care can be provided based on the patient's unique disease and treatment history, personal health record, genetic characteristics, daily routines, or eating habits, and will ultimately result in an optimised and personalised diagnosis and course of treatment. Through personalised medical care, it is possible to anticipate a patient's future health conditions; IBM Watson, an AI programme that treats cancer by utilising large amounts of gene data, is a prime example.Many people visit their doctors frequently, undergoing treatments while getting various prescriptions and reports. The medical histories of the patients may be useful and necessary to the medical professionals in an emergency. Due to time restrictions, they are unable to review the patient's medical history or the many prior reports and prescriptions. An AI-assisted blockchain-based architecture that uses optical character recognition (OCR) to create a single patient medical history report from stored medical records can effectively address this issue. The report is saved safely on a decentralised blockchain network for future use and concisely offers only the essential facts for ease and perusal.To make use of EMR data, numerous studies and projects have already been carried out. EMR data have been employed in a variety of ways in recent years as a data source for AI, and numerous studies are now being done on the approach for further multi-center development.However, not only is the right data collecting crucial, but also varied initiatives and clinical use policies are needed in order to produce AI that may be used in medicine.
